# Homework task

## Setup
 - npm install
 - npm run dev

## Notes
 - Design is heavily inspired by [a recent movie by Greta Gerwig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBk4NYhWNMM).
 - Mobx (or any other state container / flux architecture tool) not used within the project only because the author likes KISS/YAGNI design principles a bit too much.
 - TS interfaces used for server response validation and nothing else. [Please don't overuse TS.](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/static-typing--161566705352159916/)
